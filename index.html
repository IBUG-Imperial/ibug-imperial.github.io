<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am an Assistant Professor at Imperial College London. My research focuses on two main areas: (1) <strong>multi-modal foundation models</strong>, with an emphasis on perceiving, understanding, modeling, and replicating complex multi-sensory signals such as visual, acoustic, tactile, and EEG data; and (2) <strong>generative modeling of the physical world</strong>, with the goal of synthesizing scalable and reliable digital assets that reproduce real-world entities. My research is at the intersection of computer vision and real-world applications, striving to pioneer transformative technologies for social benefit. I actively serve as an Area Chair for leading conferences in computer vision and machine learning, including CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML and AAAI. I am also an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Image Processing and Neural Networks.</p> <p>Previously, I obtained my Ph.D.(2020) from the <a href="https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IBUG</a> group under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stefanos Zafeiriou</a>. My doctoral research focused on deep face analysis and modeling, encompassing efficient geometry estimation, robust feature embedding, and photorealistic texture modeling. I developed algorithms and systems (<a href="https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">InsightFace</a>) to capture, represent, and synthesize diverse human faces with high efficiency, robustness, and fidelity. Additionally, I worked in the field of visual representation learning and won many visual perception challenges (e.g., <a href="https://image-net.org/challenges/beyond_ilsvrc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ImageNet</a> and <a href="http://activity-net.org/challenges/2017/program.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ActivityNet</a>) in the past years.</p> <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_UoQFsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" style="margin-right: 15px" rel="external nofollow noopener"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar ai-lg"></i> Google Scholar</a> <a href="https://github.com/jiankangdeng" target="_blank" style="margin-right: 15px" rel="external nofollow noopener"><i class="fab fa-github fa-lg"></i> Github</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jiankangdeng" target="_blank" style="margin-right: 15px" rel="external nofollow noopener"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg"></i> Twitter</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiankangdeng" style="margin-right: 15px" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-lg"></i> LinkedIn</a> <a href="mailto:j.deng16@imperial.ac.uk" style="margin-right: 15px"><i class="far fa-envelope-open fa-lg"></i> Mail</a></p> </body></html>
